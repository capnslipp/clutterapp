DefaultRouting
==============

This is an SEO Optimization plugin that allows you to specify that one or more nested routes will not have
a path segment added to their url.

When combined with acts_as_url_param (or some other pretty url plugin), this results in nice tight urls without any extra folders in them in the cases where you can safely get away with it.

This plugin adds new new routing options:
* :default - When true, causes the resource to not generate a namespace prefix
* :show - a symbol identifying a nested resource whose index action should *replace* this resources show action.

It's important to note that using a :default nesting results in a url collision that hides the index action of the nested resource. If routing to the index action is more desirable, use the :show option instead.

Example
=======

map.namespace :forum do |forum|
  forum.resources :boards, :default => true, :show => :threads do |boards|
    boards.resources :threads, :show => posts do |threads|
      threads.resources :posts
    end
  end
end
