module Apotomo
  # The StatefulWidget is the core component in Apotomo. Any widget is derived from 
  # this class.
  #
  # === Widgets are mini-controllers
  # Widgets are derived cells[http://cells.rubyforge.org/rdoc], meaning they basically
  # look and behave like super-fast mini-controllers known from Rails. State actions in 
  # a widget are like controller actions - they implement the business logic in a method
  # and can render a corresponding view.
  # Instance variables from the widget are passed to the state view, which is
  # automatically found by convention: view filename and state method usually have the
  # same name. If you need another view, instruct the widget by calling #state_view.
  # 
  # You can plug multiple of these "mini-controllers" into a page, and you can even make
  # one widget contain others. The modeling currently happens in the WidgetTree.
  #
  # === Widgets are state machines
  # States can be connected to model a workflow. For example, a form widget could have
  # one state for diplaying an empty form, one state showing the filled-out form 
  # with messages at invalid fields, and one state showing a success message after the
  # form had valid input.
  # 
  # To send a widget - from outside - into a certain state, you usually #invoke a
  # state. Initial start states are defined in #new. Valid transitions are defined in
  # #transition_map and you can jump to an arbitrary state by calling #jump_to_state
  # inside a state method.
  #
  # When a widget changes its state, it automatically updates the respective part in the
  # page.
  # 
  # === Widgets are stateful
  # After a state transition a widget restores the last environment it was in. So you
  # have all the instance variables back that have been there when the state method
  # finished. You no longer are aware of requests, rather think in a persistent
  # environment.
  # 
  # === Widgets are event-driven
  # Unlike in traditional rails, widgets are not updated by requests 
  # directly, but by events. Events usually get triggered by form submits using 
  # ViewHelper#form_to_event, by clicking links or by real GUI events (as a 
  # <tt>onChange</tt> event in Javascript which you map to an Apotomo event with 
  # ViewHelper#address_to_event).
  # 
  # Widgets can also fire events internally using EventAware#trigger.
  # Listeners that handle an event are attached with EventAware#watch.
  
  # The brain
  # collects ivars set during state execution(s), even in successive state jumps.
  # brain content is exposed to view and unset when hitting a start state.
  # If you want to set an everlasting ivar which survives a start state, set it before
  # #render_content_for_state, best place is the constructor.
