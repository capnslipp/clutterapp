# ClutterApp

ClutterApp is an open-ended, dirt-stupid, limitlessly-hierarchical personal-information-manager, in the form of a Rails web app.

My own personal installation is at [clutterapp.com](http://clutterapp.com), where you can _[or will soon be able to]_ find out more information about the project and try it out _(but for now you'll have trust us that it's killer and install it to try it out)_.



## Requirements

A webserver running:

* Ruby 1.8.7
* Rails 2.3.11
* the authlogic gem ([rubygems.org/gems/authlogic](http://rubygems.org/gems/authlogic))
* the jrails gems ([rubygems.org/gems/jrails](http://rubygems.org/gems/jrails))



## Installation

_(Coming Soon)_

For now, replacing all instances of &lsquo;`_fill_in_`&rsquo; in the project with reasonable values (some of which can be garnered from a fresh Rails project) should work.



## Contributing

You're encouraged to contribute to ClutterApp in any way you please. All changes will be evaluated and considered, so don't be shy!

Issues may be filed for bugs, feature requests, etc. at [github.com/clutterapp/clutterapp/issues](http://github.com/clutterapp/clutterapp/issues).
